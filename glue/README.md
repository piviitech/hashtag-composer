# Hashtag Composer Docker Glue

This directory is meant for starting a dockerized nginx server, which unifies
the vuejs and flask development servers on their repective ports to one
single dev server on localhost:9000.

Doesn't work out of the box on Docker for Mac.

## Setup

Install docker. Install docker-compose. Start respective dev servers.

```
docker-compose up
```
